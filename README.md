# ðŸ§  CitiVoice System (Backend) | [CitiVoice Swagger](https://citi-voice.onrender.com/api/swagger#/)

In many regions, complaints and feedback regarding public services are handled through fragmented, informal, or outdated channels, often resulting in delayed responses, lack of accountability, and low citizen satisfaction.

The **CitizVoice System** aims to address this gap by providing a centralized, digital platform where citizens can easily submit complaints or feedback and track their resolution. Government institutions can efficiently receive, categorize, and respond to submissions via a simple, streamlined interface.
